# python-hermitcraft
Simple hermit picker that opens the latest (well, top result) video with the hermit of your choice. I tend to avoid browsing to much, so the more choices I can make in my terminal, the better. It is a really simple setup, that combines a list picker (pick) and the "play on youtube" (playonyt) functionality from the pywhatkit library.
